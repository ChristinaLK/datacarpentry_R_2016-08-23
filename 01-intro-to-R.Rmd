## Basics of R

R is a versatile, open source programming/scripting language that's useful both
for statistics but also data science. Inspired by the programming language S.

* Free/Libre/Open Source Software under the GPL.
* Superior (if not just comparable) to commercial alternatives. R has over 7,000
  user contributed packages at this time. It's widely used both in academia and
  industry.
* Available on all platforms.
* Not just for statistics, but also general purpose programming.
* For people who have experience in programmming: R is both an object-oriented
  and a so-called [functional language](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html).
* Large and growing community of peers.


## Presentation of RStudio

Let's start by learning about RStudio, the Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) that we will use to write code, navigate the files found on our computer,
inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will
generate. RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control,
developing packages) that we will not cover during the workshop.

RStudio is divided into 4 "Panes": the editor for your scripts and documents
(top-left), the R console (bottom-left), your environment/history (top-right),
and your files/plots/packages/help/viewer (bottom-right). The placement of these
panes and their content can be customized.


## R as a calculator

The lower-left pane (the R "console") is where you can interact with R
directly. The `>` sign is the R "prompt". It indicates that R is
waiting for you to type something.

You can type <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Shift`</kbd> + <kbd>`2`</kbd>
to focus just on the R console pane. Use <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> +
<kbd>`Shift`</kbd> + <kbd>`0`</kbd> to get back to the four panes. I
use this when teaching but not otherwise.

Let's start by subtracting a couple of numbers.

```{r add, results='show'}
2016 - 1969
```

R does the calculation and prints the result, and then you get the `>`
prompt again. We won't discuss what that number might mean. (The `[1]`
in the results is a bit weird; you can ignore that for now.)

You can use R as a calculator in this way.

```{r calculations, eval=FALSE}
4*6
4/6
4^6
log(4)
log10(4)
log(4, 10)
log(4, 6)
```

Here `log` is a _function_ that gives you the natural logarithm. Much of
your calculations in R will be through functions. The value in the
parentheses is called the function "argument". `log10` is another
function, that calculates the log base 10. There can be more than
one argument, and some of them may have default values. `log` has a
second argument `base` whose default (the value if left unspecified)
is _e_.

### Getting help

If you type `log` and pause for a moment, you'll get a pop-up with
information about the function.

Alternatively, you could type

```{r help, eval=FALSE}
?log
```

and the documentation for the function will show up in the lower-right
pane. These are often a bit _too_ detailed, and so they take some
practice to read. I generally focus on Usage and Arguments, and then
on Examples at the bottom. We'll talk more about getting help later.

## Need for Scripts

We can go along, typing directly into the R console. But there won't
be an easy way to keep track of what we've done.

It's best to write R "scripts" (files with R code), and work from them.
And when we start creating scripts, we need to worry about how we
organize the scripts and data for a project.

And so let's pause for a moment and talk about file organization.


## Creating an R Project

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder, called the **working directory**. All of the
scripts within this folder can then use *relative paths* to files that indicate
where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which
point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working this way makes it
a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with
others without worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts will still
work.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its "Projects"
interface, which not only creates a working directory for you but also
remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it) and optonally
preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after
a break. Below, we will go through the steps for creating an RProject for this
tutorial.

* Start RStudio (presentation of RStudio -below- should happen here)
* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `Empty project`
* Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory", in computer science), and
  choose a convenient location for it. This will be your **working directory**
  for the rest of the day (e.g., `~/data-carpentry`)
* Click on "Create project"
* Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New Folder` and
  create a folder named `data` within your newly created working directory. (e.g., `~/data-carpentry/data`)
* Create a new R script (File > New File > R script) and save it in your working
  directory (e.g. `data-carpentry-script.R`)

Your working directory should now look like this:

![How it should look like at the beginning of this lesson](img/r_starting_how_it_should_like.png)

### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will
help keep things organized, and will also make it easy find/file things in the
future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In
general, you may create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and
**documents**.

 - **`data/`** Use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate
   datasets you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For the sake
   of transparency and [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance),
   you should *always* keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much
   of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e. with scripts,
   rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from processed data
   is also a good idea. For example, you could have files
   `data/raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt` and `...plot2.txt` kept separate from
   a `data/processed/tree.survey.csv` file generated by the
   `scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R` script.
 - **`documents/`** This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts, and other text.
 - **`scripts/`** This would be the location to keep your R scripts for
   different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder for your
   functions (more on that later).

You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project
needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory. For this
workshop, you only need a `data/` folder.

![Example of a working directory structure](img/R-ecology-work_dir_structure.png)




## Interacting with R

While you can type R commands directly at the `>` prompt in the R
console, I recommend typing your commands into a script, which you'll
save for later reference, and then executing the commands from there.

Start by typing the following into the R script in the top-left pane.

```{r rscript}
# R intro

2016 - 1969
```

Save the file clicking the computer disk icon, or by typing
<kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`S`</kbd>.

Now place the cursor on the line with `2016 - 1969` and type
<kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>. The command will be copied to
the R console and executed, and then the cursor will move to the next
line.

You can also highlight a bunch of code and execute the block all at
once with <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>.


### Commenting

Use `#` signs to comment. Anything to the right of a `#` is ignored by R,
meaning it won't be executed. Comments are a great way to describe what your
code does within the code itself, so comment liberally in your R scripts.



## Assignment operator

We can assign names to numbers and other objects with the assignment
operator, `<-`. For example:

```{r assign}
age <- 2016-1969
```

Type that into your script, and use <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> +
<kbd>`Enter`</kbd> to paste it to the console.

You can also use `=` as assignment, but that symbol can have other
meanings, and so I recommend sticking with the `<-` combination.

In RStudio, typing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> will write ` <- ` in
a single keystroke.

If you've assigned a number to an object, you can then use it in
further calculations:

```{r sqrt, results='show'}
sqrt(age)
```

You can assigned _that_ to something, and then use it.

```{r round_sqrt_age}
sqrt_age <- sqrt(age)
round(sqrt_age)
round(sqrt_age, 2)
```

## Object names

Objects can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or
`subject_id`. You want your object names to be explicit and not too
long.

They cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid, but `x2` is).

R is case sensitive
(e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`). There are some names that
cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g.,
`if`, `else`, `for`, see
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)
for a complete list).

In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to not use
other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`). In doubt
check the help to see if the name is already in use.

It's also best to avoid
dots (`.`) within a variable name as in `my.dataset`. There are many functions
in R with dots in their names for historical reasons, but because dots have a
special meaning in R (for methods) and other programming languages, it's best to
avoid them. It is also recommended to use nouns for variable names, and verbs
for function names. It's important to be consistent in the styling of your code
(where you put spaces, how you name variable, etc.). In R, two popular style
guides are [Hadley Wickham's](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) and
[Google's](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml).


### Challenge

What is the value of `y` after doing the following?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 50
y <- x * 2
x <- 80
```

<!-- end challenge -->

Objects don't get linked to each other, so if you change one, it won't
affect the values of any others.

## Objects in your workspace

The objects you create get added to your "workspace". You can list the
current objects with `ls()`.

```{r ls}
ls()
```

RStudio also shows thee objects in the Environment panel.


## Vectors and data types

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Vectors and data types
```

A vector is a group of values, mainly either numbers or characters. You can
assign this set of values to a variable, just like you would for one item. For
example we can create a vector of animal weights:

```{r}
weights <- c(30, 100, 4000, 8000)
```

A vector can also contain text (character strings):

```{r}
animals <- c("rat", "cat")
```

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:

```{r}
length(weights)
length(animals)
```

An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data.
The function `class()` indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:

```{r}
class(weights)
class(animals)
```

The function `str()` provides an overview of the object and the elements it
contains. It is a really useful function when working with large and complex
objects:

```{r}
str(weights)
str(animals)
```

You can add elements to your vector by using the `c()` function:

```{r}
animals <- c(animals, "dog") # adding at the end of the vector
animals <- c("mouse", animals) # adding at the beginning of the vector
```

What happens here is that we take the original vector `animals`, and we are
adding another item first to the end of the other ones, and then another item at
the beginning. We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble
a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are
collecting or calculating.

We just saw 2 of the 6 **atomic vector** types that R uses: `"character"` and
`"numeric"`. These are the basic building blocks that all R objects are built
from. The other 4 are:

* `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
* `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` indicates to R that it's an integer)
* `"complex"` to represent complex numbers (e.g. `1+4i`)
* `"raw"` that we won't discuss further

Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that R uses. Other important
ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames (`data.frame`) and
factors (`factor`).


### Challenge

What happens to vectors with mixed types?

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 'a')

y <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)

z <- c('a', TRUE, 'b', 'c')

tricky <- c(1, '2', 3, 4)
```

Hint: use `class()`

<!-- end challenge -->

Vectors must all be of one type, and so R converts them.

`logical` → `numeric` → `character`


## Subsetting vectors

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one
or several indices in square brackets. For instance:

```{r, results='show'}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(1, 4)]
```

We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the
original one:

```{r, results='show'}
more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
```

R indexes start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, and R start
counting at 1, because that's what human beings typically do. Languages in the C
family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that's
simpler for computers to do.

### Challenge

Consider the `animals` vector.

```{r eval=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
```

Subset to get the 2nd and 3rd values.

<!-- end challenge -->

### Conditional subsetting

Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector: `TRUE` will
select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not:

```{r, results='show'}
x <- c(21, 54, 39, 17, 55)
x[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of
other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the
values above 50:

```{r, results='show'}
x > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
x[x > 50]
```

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|`
(at least one of the conditions is true, OR):

```{r, results='show'}
x[x < 30 | x > 50]
x[x > 30 & x < 50]
```

When working with vectors of characters, if you are trying to combine many
conditions it can become tedious to type. The function `%in%` allows you to test
if a value if found in a vector:

```{r, results='show'}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] # returns both rat and cat
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck")
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck")]
```

### Challenge

Consider the following two vectors.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "cat", "dog")
weights <- c(30, 180, 4000, 8000)
```

Subset `animals` with `weights < 200`.

<!-- end challenge -->



## Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data
(which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented
in vectors as `NA`.

```{r}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
```

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data
you are working with include missing values. It is a safer behavior as otherwise
you may overlook that you are dealing with missing data. You can add the
argument `na.rm=TRUE` to calculate the result while ignoring the missing values.

```{r}
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()` and `na.omit()`.
examples.


```{r}
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]
## shortcut to that
na.omit(heights)
```


### Challenge

Why does the following give an error?

```{r mean_na, eval=FALSE}
v <- c(2, 4, 4, "NA", 6)
mean(v, na.rm=TRUE)
```

Why does the error message say the data are not numeric?

<!-- end challenge -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
source("setup.R")
```

## Presentation of the Survey Data

We will continue to look at the species and weight of animals caught
in plots in a study area in Arizona over time. The dataset is stored
as a CSV file: each row holds information for a single animal, and the
columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus            | genus of animal                    |
| species          | species of animal                  |
| taxa             | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| plot\_type       | type of plot                       |

The data are available at <http://kbroman.org/datacarp/portal_data_joined.csv>.

We first use `download_file()` to download the data into the `data/` subdirectory:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
download.file("http://kbroman.org/datacarp/portal_data_joined.csv",
              "data/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

We then use `read.csv()` to load the data into R:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
surveys <- read.csv('data/portal_data_joined.csv')
```

We can actually use `read.csv` to grab the data directly from the web,
but it's probably best to download a copy first.

```{r eval=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv("http://kbroman.org/datacarp/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

The data are stored in what's called a "data frame". It's a big
rectangle, with rows being observations and columns being
variables. The different columns can be different types (numeric,
character, etc.), but they're all the same length.

Use `head()` to view the first few rows.

```{r head}
head(surveys)
```

Use `tail()` to view the first few rows.

```{r tail}
tail(surveys)
```

Use `str()` to look at the structure of the data.

```{r str}
str(surveys)
```

### Challenge

Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

* What is the class of the object `surveys`?
* How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
* How many species have been recorded during these surveys?

<!-- end challenge -->

As you can see, many of the columns consist of integers, however, the columns
`species` and `sex` are of a special class called a `factor`. Before we learn
more about the `data.frame` class, let's talk about factors. They are very
useful but not necessarily intuitive, and therefore require some attention.


## Factors

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered or
unordered, and understanding them is necessary for statistical analysis and for
plotting.

Factors are stored as integers, and have labels associated with these unique
integers. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are
actually integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when treating them
like strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as
*levels*. By default, R always sorts *levels* in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you use `factor()` to create a factor with 2 levels:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"` (because
`f` comes before `m`, even though the first element in this vector is
`"male"`). You can check this by using the function `levels()`, and check the
number of levels using `nlevels()`:

```{r}
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want
to specify a particular order.

```{r, purl=TRUE}
food <- factor(c("low", "high", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)
food <- factor(food, levels=c("low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)
```


### Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use
`as.character(x)`.

Converting factors where the levels appear as numbers (such as concentration
levels) to a numeric vector is a little trickier.  One method is to convert
factors to characters and then numbers.
function. Compare:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
f <- factor(c(1, 5, 10, 2))
as.numeric(f)               ## wrong! and there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(f)) ## works...
```

### Challenge

The function `table()` tabulates observations.

```{r table, eval=FALSE}
expt <- c("treat1", "treat2", "treat1", "treat3", "treat1",
          "control", "treat1", "treat2", "treat3")
expt <- factor(expt)
table(expt)
```

* In which order are the treatments listed?
* How can you recreate this table with "`control`" listed last instead
of first?

<!-- end challenge -->

<!---
```{r correct-order}
## Answers
##
## * The treatments are listed in alphabetical order because they are factors.
## * By redefining the order of the levels
expt <- c("treat1", "treat2", "treat1", "treat3", "treat1",
          "control", "treat1", "treat2", "treat3")
expt <- factor(expt, levels=c("treat1", "treat2", "treat3", "control"))
table(expt)
```
--->

## stringsAsFactors

The default when reading in data with `read.csv()`, columns with text
get turned into factors.

You can avoid this with the argument `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`.

```{r}
surveys_chr <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

Then when you look at the result of `str()`, you'll see that the
previously factor columns are now `chr`.

```{r}
str(surveys_chr)
```

## Constructing data frames "by hand"

You can also create a data frame manually with the function `data.frame()`. This
function can also take the argument `stringsAsFactors`. Compare the output of
these examples, and compare the difference between when the data are being read
as `character`, and when they are being read as `factor`.

```{r, results='show'}
df1 <- data.frame(animal=c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"),
                  feel=c("furry", "furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
                  weight=c(45, 8, 1.1, 0.8))
str(df1)

df2 <- data.frame(animal=c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"),
                  feel=c("furry", "furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
                  weight=c(45, 8, 1.1, 0.8), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(df2)
```

### Challenge

There are a few mistakes in this hand crafted `data.frame`, can you spot and
fix them? Don't hesitate to experiment!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
author_book <- data.frame(author_first=c("Charles", "Ernst", "Theodosius"),
                          author_last=c(Darwin, Mayr, Dobzhansky),
                          year=c(1942, 1970))
```

<!-- end challenge -->

## Inspecting data frames

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a `data.frame`. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data.

* Size:
    * `dim()` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,
      and the number of columns as the second element (the __dim__ensions of the
      object)
    * `nrow()` - returns the number of rows
    * `ncol()` - returns the number of columns

* Content:
    * `head()` - shows the first 6 rows
    * `tail()` - shows the last 6 rows

* Names:
    * `names()` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame`
       objects)
    * `rownames()` - returns the row names

* Summary:
    * `str()` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and
       content of  each column
    * `summary()` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.

## Indexing, Sequences, and Subsetting

We pulled out parts of a vector by indexing with square brackets. We
can do the same thing with data frames, but we need to provide two
values: row and column, with a comma between them.

For example, to get the element in the 1st row, 1st column:

```{r}
surveys[1,1]
```

To get the element in the 2nd row, 7th column:

```{r}
surveys[2,7]
```

To get the entire 2nd row, leave the column part blank:

```{r}
surveys[2,]
```

And to get the entire 7th column, leave the row part blank:

```{r}
sex <- surveys[,7]
```

You can also refer to columns by name, in multiple ways.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sex <- surveys[, "sex"]
ssex <- surveys[["sex"]]
sex <- surveys$sex
```

### Treating blanks as missing

Another aside: it's probably best to treat those blanks as missing
(`NA`). To do that, use the argument `na.strings` when reading the
data. `na.strings` can be a vector of multiple character strings. We
need that a missing value code can never exist as a valid value,
because they all will be converted to the missing data code `NA`.  And
note that the default for `na.strings` is `"NA"`, which will cause
problems if `"NA"` is a valid value for your data (e.g., as an
abbreviation `"North America"`).

```{r}
surveys_noblanks <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv", na.strings="")
```


### Slices

As with vectors, you can also use logical vectors when indexing.

```{r}
weights_males <- surveys[surveys$sex == 'M', "weight"]
mean(weights_males, na.rm=TRUE)

mean(surveys[surveys$sex == 'F', "weight"], na.rm=TRUE)
```

Or you can use numeric vectors. To pull out larger slices, it's
helpful to have ways of creating sequences of numbers.

First, the operator `:` gives you a sequence of consecutive values.


```{r}
1:10
10:1
5:8
```

`seq` is more flexible.

```{r}
seq(1, 10, by=2)
seq(5, 10, length.out=3)
seq(50, by=5, length.out=10)
seq(1, 8, by=3) # sequence stops to stay below upper limit
seq(10, 2, by=-2)  # can also go backwards
```




To get slices of our data frame, we can include a vector for the row
or column indexes (or both)

```{r}
surveys[1:3, 7]   # first three elements in the 7th column
surveys[1, 1:3]   # first three columns in the first row
surveys[2:4, 6:7] # rows 2-4, columns 6-7
```


### Challenge

1. The function `nrow()` on a `data.frame` returns the number of rows. Use it,
   in conjuction with `seq()` to create a new `data.frame` called
   `surveys_by_10` that includes every 10th row of the survey data frame
   starting at row 10 (10, 20, 30, ...)

1. Create a `data.frame` containing only the observations from the
   year 1999 of the `surveys` dataset.
