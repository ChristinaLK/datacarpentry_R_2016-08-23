<div id="basics-of-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Basics of R</h2>
<p>R is a versatile, open source programming/scripting language that’s useful both for statistics but also data science. Inspired by the programming language S.</p>
<ul>
<li>Free/Libre/Open Source Software under the GPL.</li>
<li>Superior (if not just comparable) to commercial alternatives. R has over 7,000 user contributed packages at this time. It’s widely used both in academia and industry.</li>
<li>Available on all platforms.</li>
<li>Not just for statistics, but also general purpose programming.</li>
<li>For people who have experience in programmming: R is both an object-oriented and a so-called <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html">functional language</a>.</li>
<li>Large and growing community of peers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="presentation-of-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Presentation of RStudio</h2>
<p>Let’s start by learning about RStudio, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that we will use to write code, navigate the files found on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will generate. RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages) that we will not cover during the workshop.</p>
<p>RStudio is divided into 4 “Panes”: the editor for your scripts and documents (top-left), the R console (bottom-left), your environment/history (top-right), and your files/plots/packages/help/viewer (bottom-right). The placement of these panes and their content can be customized.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-as-a-calculator" class="section level2">
<h2>R as a calculator</h2>
<p>The lower-left pane (the R “console”) is where you can interact with R directly. The <code>&gt;</code> sign is the R “prompt”. It indicates that R is waiting for you to type something.</p>
<p>You can type <kbd><code>Ctrl</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>Shift</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>2</code></kbd> to focus just on the R console pane. Use <kbd><code>Ctrl</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>Shift</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>0</code></kbd> to get back to the four panes. I use this when teaching but not otherwise.</p>
<p>Let’s start by subtracting a couple of numbers.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="dv">2016</span> -<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">1969</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 47</code></pre>
<p>R does the calculation and prints the result, and then you get the <code>&gt;</code> prompt again. We won’t discuss what that number might mean. (The <code>[1]</code> in the results is a bit weird; you can ignore that for now.)</p>
<p>You can use R as a calculator in this way.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="dv">4</span>*<span class="dv">6</span>
<span class="dv">4</span>/<span class="dv">6</span>
<span class="dv">4</span>^<span class="dv">6</span>
<span class="kw">log</span>(<span class="dv">4</span>)
<span class="kw">log10</span>(<span class="dv">4</span>)
<span class="kw">log</span>(<span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">10</span>)
<span class="kw">log</span>(<span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">6</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Here <code>log</code> is a <em>function</em> that gives you the natural logarithm. Much of your calculations in R will be through functions. The value in the parentheses is called the function “argument”. <code>log10</code> is another function, that calculates the log base 10. There can be more than one argument, and some of them may have default values. <code>log</code> has a second argument <code>base</code> whose default (the value if left unspecified) is <em>e</em>.</p>
<div id="getting-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting help</h3>
<p>If you type <code>log</code> and pause for a moment, you’ll get a pop-up with information about the function.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could type</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">?log</code></pre></div>
<p>and the documentation for the function will show up in the lower-right pane. These are often a bit <em>too</em> detailed, and so they take some practice to read. I generally focus on Usage and Arguments, and then on Examples at the bottom. We’ll talk more about getting help later.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="need-for-scripts" class="section level2">
<h2>Need for Scripts</h2>
<p>We can go along, typing directly into the R console. But there won’t be an easy way to keep track of what we’ve done.</p>
<p>It’s best to write R “scripts” (files with R code), and work from them. And when we start creating scripts, we need to worry about how we organize the scripts and data for a project.</p>
<p>And so let’s pause for a moment and talk about file organization.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-an-r-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating an R Project</h2>
<p>It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text self-contained in a single folder, called the <strong>working directory</strong>. All of the scripts within this folder can then use <em>relative paths</em> to files that indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with others without worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts will still work.</p>
<p>RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its “Projects” interface, which not only creates a working directory for you but also remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it) and optonally preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after a break. Below, we will go through the steps for creating an RProject for this tutorial.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start RStudio (presentation of RStudio -below- should happen here)</li>
<li>Under the <code>File</code> menu, click on <code>New project</code>, choose <code>New directory</code>, then <code>Empty project</code></li>
<li>Enter a name for this new folder (or “directory”, in computer science), and choose a convenient location for it. This will be your <strong>working directory</strong> for the rest of the day (e.g., <code>~/data-carpentry</code>)</li>
<li>Click on “Create project”</li>
<li>Under the <code>Files</code> tab on the right of the screen, click on <code>New Folder</code> and create a folder named <code>data</code> within your newly created working directory. (e.g., <code>~/data-carpentry/data</code>)</li>
<li>Create a new R script (File &gt; New File &gt; R script) and save it in your working directory (e.g. <code>data-carpentry-script.R</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your working directory should now look like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/r_starting_how_it_should_like.png" alt="How it should look like at the beginning of this lesson" />
<p class="caption">How it should look like at the beginning of this lesson</p>
</div>
<div id="organizing-your-working-directory" class="section level3">
<h3>Organizing your working directory</h3>
<p>Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may create directories (folders) for <strong>scripts</strong>, <strong>data</strong>, and <strong>documents</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>data/</code></strong> Use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate datasets you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For the sake of transparency and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance">provenance</a>, you should <em>always</em> keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e. with scripts, rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from processed data is also a good idea. For example, you could have files <code>data/raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt</code> and <code>...plot2.txt</code> kept separate from a <code>data/processed/tree.survey.csv</code> file generated by the <code>scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R</code> script.</li>
<li><strong><code>documents/</code></strong> This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts, and other text.</li>
<li><strong><code>scripts/</code></strong> This would be the location to keep your R scripts for different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder for your functions (more on that later).</li>
</ul>
<p>You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory. For this workshop, you only need a <code>data/</code> folder.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<div id="interacting-with-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Interacting with R</h2>
<p>While you can type R commands directly at the <code>&gt;</code> prompt in the R console, I recommend typing your commands into a script, which you’ll save for later reference, and then executing the commands from there.</p>
<p>Start by typing the following into the R script in the top-left pane.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># R intro</span>

<span class="dv">2016</span> -<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">1969</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Save the file clicking the computer disk icon, or by typing <kbd><code>Ctrl</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>S</code></kbd>.</p>
<p>Now place the cursor on the line with <code>2016 - 1969</code> and type <kbd><code>Ctrl</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>Enter</code></kbd>. The command will be copied to the R console and executed, and then the cursor will move to the next line.</p>
<p>You can also highlight a bunch of code and execute the block all at once with <kbd><code>Ctrl</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>Enter</code></kbd>.</p>
<div id="commenting" class="section level3">
<h3>Commenting</h3>
<p>Use <code>#</code> signs to comment. Anything to the right of a <code>#</code> is ignored by R, meaning it won’t be executed. Comments are a great way to describe what your code does within the code itself, so comment liberally in your R scripts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="seeking-help" class="section level2">
<h2>Seeking help</h2>
<div id="i-know-the-name-of-the-function-i-want-to-use-but-im-not-sure-how-to-use-it" class="section level3">
<h3>I know the name of the function I want to use, but I’m not sure how to use it</h3>
<p>If you need help with a specific function, let’s say <code>barplot()</code>, you can type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">?barplot</code></pre></div>
<p>If you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">args</span>(lm)</code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="i-want-to-use-a-function-that-does-x-there-must-be-a-function-for-it-but-i-dont-know-which-one" class="section level3">
<h3>I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don’t know which one…</h3>
<p>If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use <code>help.search()</code> function, which is called by the double question mark <code>??</code>. However, this only looks through the installed packages for help pages with a match to your search request</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">??kruskal</code></pre></div>
<p>If you can’t find what you are looking for, you can use the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org">rdocumention.org</a> website that search through the help files across all packages available.</p>
</div>
<div id="i-am-stuck-i-get-an-error-message-that-i-dont-understand" class="section level3">
<h3>I am stuck… I get an error message that I don’t understand</h3>
<p>Start by googling the error message. However, this doesn’t always work very well because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a problem (e.g. “subscript out of bounds”). If the message is very generic, you might also include the name of the function or package you’re using in your query.</p>
<p>However, you should check StackOverflow. Search using the <code>[r]</code> tag. Most questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right words in the search to find the answers: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r" class="uri">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">Introduction to R</a> can also be dense for people with little programming experience but it is a good place to understand the underpinnings of the R language.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html">R FAQ</a> is dense and technical but it is full of useful information.</p>
</div>
<div id="asking-for-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Asking for help</h3>
<p>The key to get help from someone is for them to grasp your problem rapidly. You should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.</p>
<p>Try to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a package is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand what you meant, but others have really strong feelings about the difference in meaning. The key point is that it can make things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as precise as possible when describing your problem.</p>
<p>If possible, try to reduce what doesn’t work to a simple reproducible example. If you can reproduce the problem using a very small <code>data.frame</code> instead of your 50,000 rows and 10,000 columns one, provide the small one with the description of your problem. When appropriate, try to generalize what you are doing so even people who are not in your field can understand the question.</p>
<p>To share an object with someone else, if it’s relatively small, you can use the function <code>dput()</code>. It will output R code that can be used to recreate the exact same object as the one in memory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">dput</span>(<span class="kw">head</span>(iris)) <span class="co"># iris is an example data.frame that comes with R</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## structure(list(Sepal.Length = c(5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6, 5, 5.4), 
##     Sepal.Width = c(3.5, 3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.6, 3.9), Petal.Length = c(1.4, 
##     1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.7), Petal.Width = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 
##     0.2, 0.2, 0.4), Species = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 
##     1L), .Label = c(&quot;setosa&quot;, &quot;versicolor&quot;, &quot;virginica&quot;), class = &quot;factor&quot;)), .Names = c(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;, 
## &quot;Sepal.Width&quot;, &quot;Petal.Length&quot;, &quot;Petal.Width&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;), row.names = c(NA, 
## 6L), class = &quot;data.frame&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>If the object is larger, provide either the raw file (i.e., your CSV file) with your script up to the point of the error (and after removing everything that is not relevant to your issue). Alternatively, in particular if your questions is not related to a <code>data.frame</code>, you can save any R object to a file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">saveRDS</span>(iris, <span class="dt">file=</span><span class="st">&quot;/tmp/iris.rds&quot;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>The content of this file is however not human readable and cannot be posted directly on stackoverflow. It can however be sent to someone by email who can read it with this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">some_data &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">readRDS</span>(<span class="dt">file=</span><span class="st">&quot;~/Downloads/iris.rds&quot;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, <strong>always include the output of <code>sessionInfo()</code></strong> as it provides critical information about your platform, the versions of R and the packages that you are using, and other information that can be very helpful to understand your problem.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">sessionInfo</span>()</code></pre></div>

<h3>Where to ask for help?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your friendly colleagues: if you know someone with more experience than you, they might be able and willing to help you.</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r">StackOverflow</a>: if your question hasn’t been answered before and is well crafted, chances are you will get an answer in less than 5 min.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help">R-help mailing list</a>: it is read by a lot of people (including most of the R core team), a lot of people post to it, but the tone can be pretty dry, and it is not always very welcoming to new users. If your question is valid, you are likely to get an answer very fast but don’t expect that it will come with smiley faces. Also, here more than everywhere else, be sure to use correct vocabulary (otherwise you might get an answer pointing to the misuse of your words rather than answering your question). You will also have more success if your question is about a base function rather than a specific package.</li>
<li>If your question is about a specific package, see if there is a mailing list for it.
