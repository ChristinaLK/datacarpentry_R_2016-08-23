# Basics of R

R is a versatile, open source programming/scripting language that's useful both
for statistics but also data science. Inspired by the programming language S.

* Free/Libre/Open Source Software under the GPL.
* Superior (if not just comparable) to commercial alternatives. R has over 7,000
  user contributed packages at this time. It's widely used both in academia and
  industry.
* Available on all platforms.
* Not just for statistics, but also general purpose programming.
* For people who have experience in programmming: R is both an object-oriented
  and a so-called [functional language](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html).
* Large and growing community of peers.


# Presentation of RStudio

Let's start by learning about RStudio, the Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) that we will use to write code, navigate the files found on our computer,
inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will
generate. RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control,
developing packages) that we will not cover during the workshop.

RStudio is divided into 4 "Panes": the editor for your scripts and documents
(top-left), the R console (bottom-left), your environment/history (top-right),
and your files/plots/packages/help/viewer (bottom-right). The placement of these
panes and their content can be customized.


# R as a calculator

The lower-left pane (the R "console") is where you can interact with R
directly. The `>` sign is the R "prompt". It indicates that R is
waiting for you to type something.

You can type <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Shift`</kbd> + <kbd>`2`</kbd>
to focus just on the R console pane. Use <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> +
<kbd>`Shift`</kbd> + <kbd>`0`</kbd> to get back to the four panes. I
use this when teaching but not otherwise.

Let's start by subtracting a couple of numbers.

```{r add, results="markup"}
2016 - 1969
```

R does the calculation and prints the result, and then you get the `>`
prompt again. We won't discuss what that number might mean. (The `[1]`
in the results is a bit weird; you can ignore that for now.)

You can use R as a calculator in this way.

```{r calculations, eval=FALSE}
4*6
4/6
4^6
log(4)
log10(4)
log(4, 10)
log(4, 6)
```

Here `log` is a _function_ that gives you the natural logarithm. Much of
your calculations in R will be through functions. The value in the
parentheses is called the function "argument". `log10` is another
function, that calculates the log base 10. There can be more than
one argument, and some of them may have default values. `log` has a
second argument `base` whose default (the value if left unspecified)
is _e_.

# Getting help

If you type `log` and pause for a moment, you'll get a pop-up with
information about the function.

Alternatively, you could type

```{r help, eval=FALSE}
?log
```

and the documentation for the function will show up in the lower-right
pane. These are often a bit _too_ detailed, and so they take some
practice to read. I generally focus on Usage and Arguments, and then
on Examples at the bottom. We'll talk more about getting help later.

# Need for Scripts

We can go along, typing directly into the R console. But there won't
be an easy way to keep track of what we've done.

It's best to write R "scripts" (files with R code), and work from them.
And when we start creating scripts, we need to worry about how we
organize the scripts and data for a project.

And so let's pause for a moment and talk about file organization.


# Creating an R Project

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder, called the **working directory**. All of the
scripts within this folder can then use *relative paths* to files that indicate
where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which
point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working this way makes it
a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with
others without worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts will still
work.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its "Projects"
interface, which not only creates a working directory for you but also
remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it) and optonally
preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after
a break. Below, we will go through the steps for creating an RProject for this
tutorial.

* Start RStudio (presentation of RStudio -below- should happen here)
* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `Empty project`
* Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory", in computer science), and
  choose a convenient location for it. This will be your **working directory**
  for the rest of the day (e.g., `~/data-carpentry`)
* Click on "Create project"
* Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New Folder` and
  create a folder named `data` within your newly created working directory. (e.g., `~/data-carpentry/data`)
* Create a new R script (File > New File > R script) and save it in your working
  directory (e.g. `data-carpentry-script.R`)

Your working directory should now look like this:

![How it should look like at the beginning of this lesson](img/r_starting_how_it_should_like.png)

## Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will
help keep things organized, and will also make it easy find/file things in the
future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In
general, you may create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and
**documents**.

 - **`data/`** Use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate
   datasets you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For the sake
   of transparency and [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance),
   you should *always* keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much
   of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e. with scripts,
   rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from processed data
   is also a good idea. For example, you could have files
   `data/raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt` and `...plot2.txt` kept separate from
   a `data/processed/tree.survey.csv` file generated by the
   `scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R` script.
 - **`documents/`** This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts, and other text.
 - **`scripts/`** This would be the location to keep your R scripts for
   different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder for your
   functions (more on that later).

You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project
needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory. For this
workshop, you only need a `data/` folder.

# Interacting with R

While you can type R commands directly at the `>` prompt in the R
console, I recommend typing your commands into a script, which you'll
save for later reference, and then executing the commands from there.

Start by typing the following into the R script in the top-left pane.

```{r rscript}
# R intro

2016 - 1969
```

Save the file clicking the computer disk icon, or by typing
<kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`S`</kbd>.

Now place the cursor on the line with `2016 - 1969` and type
<kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>. The command will be copied to
the R console and executed, and then the cursor will move to the next
line.

You can also highlight a bunch of code and execute the block all at
once with <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>.


## Commenting

Use `#` signs to comment. Anything to the right of a `#` is ignored by R,
meaning it won't be executed. Comments are a great way to describe what your
code does within the code itself, so comment liberally in your R scripts.



## Seeking help

### I know the name of the function I want to use, but I'm not sure how to use it

If you need help with a specific function, let's say `barplot()`, you can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
?barplot
```

If you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
args(lm)
```

### I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don't know which one...

If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use
`help.search()` function, which is called by the double question mark `??`.
However, this only looks through the installed packages for help pages with a
match to your search request

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
??kruskal
```

If you can't find what you are looking for, you can use the
[rdocumention.org](http://www.rdocumentation.org) website that search through
the help files across all packages available.

### I am stuck... I get an error message that I don't understand

Start by googling the error message. However, this doesn't always work very well
because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You
end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a
problem (e.g. "subscript out of bounds"). If the message is very generic, you might
also include the name of the function or package you're using in your query.

However, you should check StackOverflow. Search using the `[r]` tag. Most
questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right
words in the search to find the answers:
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

The [Introduction to R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf) can
also be dense for people with little programming experience but it is a good
place to understand the underpinnings of the R language.

The [R FAQ](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html) is dense and technical
but it is full of useful information.

### Asking for help

The key to get help from someone is for them to grasp your problem rapidly. You
should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.

Try to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a package
is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand what you meant,
but others have really strong feelings about the difference in meaning. The key
point is that it can make things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as
precise as possible when describing your problem.

If possible, try to reduce what doesn't work to a simple reproducible
example. If you can reproduce the problem using a very small `data.frame`
instead of your 50,000 rows and 10,000 columns one, provide the small one with
the description of your problem. When appropriate, try to generalize what you
are doing so even people who are not in your field can understand the question.

To share an object with someone else, if it's relatively small, you can use the
function `dput()`. It will output R code that can be used to recreate the exact
same object as the one in memory:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
dput(head(iris)) # iris is an example data.frame that comes with R
```

If the object is larger, provide either the raw file (i.e., your CSV file) with
your script up to the point of the error (and after removing everything that is
not relevant to your issue). Alternatively, in particular if your questions is
not related to a `data.frame`, you can save any R object to a file:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
saveRDS(iris, file="/tmp/iris.rds")
```

The content of this file is however not human readable and cannot be posted
directly on stackoverflow. It can however be sent to someone by email who can
read it with this command:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
some_data <- readRDS(file="~/Downloads/iris.rds")
```

Last, but certainly not least, **always include the output of `sessionInfo()`**
as it provides critical information about your platform, the versions of R and
the packages that you are using, and other information that can be very helpful
to understand your problem.

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

### Where to ask for help?

* Your friendly colleagues: if you know someone with more experience than you,
  they might be able and willing to help you.
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): if your question
  hasn't been answered before and is well crafted, chances are you will get an
  answer in less than 5 min.
* The [R-help mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help): it is
  read by a lot of people (including most of the R core team), a lot of people
  post to it, but the tone can be pretty dry, and it is not always very
  welcoming to new users. If your question is valid, you are likely to get an
  answer very fast but don't expect that it will come with smiley faces. Also,
  here more than everywhere else, be sure to use correct vocabulary (otherwise
  you might get an answer pointing to the misuse of your words rather than
  answering your question). You will also have more success if your question is
  about a base function rather than a specific package.
* If your question is about a specific package, see if there is a mailing list
  for it. Usually it's included in the DESCRIPTION file of the package that can
  be accessed using `packageDescription("name-of-package")`. You may also want
  to try to email the author of the package directly.
* There are also some topic-specific mailing lists (GIS, phylogenetics, etc...),
  the complete list is [here](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html).
