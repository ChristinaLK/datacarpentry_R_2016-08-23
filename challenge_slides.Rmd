# Challenge 1


What is the value of `y` after doing the following?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 55
y <- x * 2.2
x <- 100
```


---

# Challenge 2


What happens to vectors with mixed types?

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 'a')

y <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)

z <- c('a', 'b', 'c', TRUE)

tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, '4')
```

Hint: use `class()`

# Challenge 3


Consider the following two vectors.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "cat", "dog")
weights <- c(30, 180, 4000, 8000)
```

Subset `animals` with `weights < 200`.

# Challenge 4


Why does the following give an error?

```{r mean_na, eval=FALSE}
v <- c(2, 4, 4, "NA", 6)
mean(v, na.rm=TRUE)
```

Why does the error message say the data are not numeric?
